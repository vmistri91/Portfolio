This is a portfolio of GIS based work I have created in RStudio, using techniques I have learned at university, and techniques I have taught myself. I am a BA Geography with Social Data Science student at University College London with an interest in GIS and mapping data. This portfolio shows many pieces of work I have produced in RStudio, from geographic reports on crime, to explaining fundamental concepts in mapping with examples.
