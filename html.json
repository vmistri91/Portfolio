The aim was to produce a variety of maps to create a 'social atlas' of any set of data across an area of the United Kingdom. This particular project studies weapon possession crimes in West Midlands County, and uses a variety of different map types to illustrate this.\n\nFeel free to skip to the maps and analysis of these maps in the report. If you are interested in the coding, design, methodology, and many other choices made, I recommend reading the full report to understand why certain decisions were made in this report.\n\nThe main reason weapon possession crimes were chosen for this project was because these have been brought increasingly to the public eye over recent years, with celebrities, such as Idris Elba calling for an “immediate ban on machetes and ‘zombie’ knives”. West Midlands County has the highest rates of weapon possession incidents in the United Kingdom as of 2024, with Birmingham having the highest rates of knife crime in this region.\n\nI would like to thank Professor Justin van Dijk, Lecturer in Social and Geographic Data Science at UCL, for providing assistance and insights to help me create this report, and teaching me some of the techniques used in this report in RStudio. You can visit his website here: <https://mappingdutchman.com/>.\n\n## Data Sources\n\nAll spatial boundaries have been downloaded from the ONS Open Geography Portal <https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/>. Boundaries used include: 2021 Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) Boundaries UK, 2023 Local Authority District Boundaries UK, 2018 Metropolitan County Boundaries UK, 2023 Ward Boundaries UK.\n\nPolice crime data can be downloaded from <https://data.police.uk/data/>, and the West Midlands Police Force was selected, and data was downloaded across all months of 2023.\n\nTo obtain Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) data by LSOA, a free account can be made on the Consumer Data Research Centre website <https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/>, allowing 2019 IMD scores by LSOA to be downloaded as a .csv file.\n\nTo obtain 2021 census data variables (population by LSOA, unemployment by ward), the Nomis website can be used <https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/>.\n\nPopulation data from 2020 in raster format, at a 1km resolution for the United Kingdom was downloaded from WorldPop via this link <https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/summary?id=34480>.\n\nOpenStreetMap data was downloaded through R using the 'osmdata' package.\n\nAll of the files used in this report can be found in the folder titled 'Weapon_Social_Atlas_Files' on my GitHub page here <https://github.com/vmistri91/Portfolio>.\n\n## Loading Packages\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nThese are all the packages used in this project.

Additionally, the style has been changed to \"fixed\" indicating that the class breaks on this map are going to be pre-specified, as shown in the 'breaks =' line of the code chunk. Borders have been added around each local authority for clarity, and the 'tm_layout' chunk allows elements such as the legend, title and font size to be altered in the map.

When reproducing the code in R, increase the size of the plot window, and the these labels will all fit.\n\nThis map appears to show that areas in Central Birmingham, Central Wolverhampton and Central Coventry see the highest rates of weapon possession crimes, with most of Solihull, except the city centre, having the lowest rates. An issue of this map is that each zone is a different size, due to how census data is measured in the United Kingdom in Output Areas. This LSOA map is prone to the effects of the Multiple Aerial Unit Problem (MAUP), where trends within each LSOA can be masked due to the 'zoning effect'. The crime point data has all been aggregated at the LSOA level, but each LSOA is differently sized, so this can create inconsistencies in the data analysis.

Birmingham has the greatest number hexagons with weapon crimes occurring, with over half of its area having a minimum of 0.1 weapon crimes occurring per 1000 people. These higher crime rates are mostly concentrated around Birmingham city centre. This pattern is similar for the other authorities, most evident in Coventry and Wolverhampton.\n\n## Spatial Autocorrelation\n\nWhile the hexagon map produced above is useful for identifying weapon possession crime trends, further geospatial queries and techniques can be conducted on the dataset. One useful technique is spatial autocorrelation, which measures the degree to which similar values (of crime) occur near eachother in a study region, in a positive or negative manner. This concept links to Tobler's Fist Law of Geography which is \"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things\", a foundational concept in GIS.\n\nIn order to conduct spatial autocorrelation, the neighbour radius of each hexagon needs to be defined, to conduct a spatial weights matrix, which helps to quantify the influence of a particular hexagon on surrounding hexagons. This is used to calculate Global and Local measures of Spatial Autocorrelation.\n\nIn this particular study, a fixed distance neighbour definition is used, which defines a hexagon's neighbours as spatial units which lie within a fixed distance (in this case 1500 metre radius) of the particular hexagon.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Calculate fixed distance neighbours\nhex_neighbours_fd <- dnearneigh(st_geometry(st_centroid(honeycomb_grid_wm)),\n                                 0, 1500)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Calculate centroids of all hex grids in West Midlands county\nhex_centroid <- honeycomb_grid_wm |>\n  st_centroid()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: st_centroid assumes attributes are constant over geometries\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Plot fixed distance neighbours\nplot(hex_neighbours_fd, st_geometry(hex_centroid), col = \"blue\", pch = 20, cex = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](weapon_crime_social_atlas_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Create neighbours list\nhex_spatial_weights_fd <- hex_neighbours_fd |>\n  nb2listw(style = \"W\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nCentroids of each hexagon are used in the neighbour determination, as this provides a uniform method of defining where the 1500 metre radius should be drawn from each hexagon.\n\nGlobal spatial autocorrelation measures identify the degree of clustering or dispersion of the data in the entire study area. The most commonly used global method is Moran's I, which quantifies the degree of autocorrelation, providing correlation coefficients between an area and its neighbours. A score is provided between 1 and -1, with 1 indicating perfect clustering, and -1 indicating perfect dispersion across the region.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Create a Moran's plot\nmoran.plot(honeycomb_grid_wm$weaponcrime_rate, listw = hex_spatial_weights_fd)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](weapon_crime_social_atlas_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Conduct Moran's I\nmoran_fd <- honeycomb_grid_wm |>\n  pull(weaponcrime_rate) |>\n  as.vector() |>\n  moran.test(hex_spatial_weights_fd)\n\n#Inspect result\nmoran_fd\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tMoran I test under randomisation\n\ndata:  as.vector(pull(honeycomb_grid_wm, weaponcrime_rate))  \nweights: hex_spatial_weights_fd    \n\nMoran I statistic standard deviate = 15.123, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: greater\nsample estimates:\nMoran I statistic       Expectation          Variance \n     3.944465e-02     -2.251745e-04      6.880482e-06 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#=3.944465e-02\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe overall value of Moran's I is 3.944465e-02, indicating there is little to no spatial autocorrelation among weapon possession crime rates in the study area.

High-low identifies areas with a high value surrounded by areas with low values, and Low-high identifies areas with a low value surrounded by areas with high values, essentially identifying hexagons which are outliers.\n\nTo create this map, significance breaks and a significance level need to be set.

The Getis Ord Gi\\* statistic can be calculated for each hexagon and a hot/cold spot map can be produced across the study area. This method was proposed by Getis and Ord (1992) here <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x>. The method compares local values to the global sum, considering spatial relationships between neighbours; and the method incorporates the spatial weights matrix and computes z-scores to determine significance. Using z-scores, adjusting for significance, hotspots and cold spots can be determined where higher z-scores indicate hotspots and lower z-scores indicate cold spots.\n\nUsing the defined fixed

Orange coloured areas, such as most of Wolverhampton, central Coventry and Walsall have a negative correlation between the IMD and the weapon crime rate. Areas in the green colour, such as central Birmingham and north and south Solihull show a positive correlation between weapon crime rate and IMD scores. This result was expected as other studies have found a link between deprivation and knife crime.\n\n## Focus on Birmingham\n\nDue to the GWR results suggesting that there is a positive correlation between deprivation and the weapon possession rate, and that Birmingham is the largest city/local authority in the county, the area has been selected for further analysis of weapon crimes.\n\nAnother factor as suggested by academics which links to crime is unemployment, so the first part of the Birmingham analysis will may unemployment across each Ward in the authority, and provide locations of where weapon possession crimes took place.\n\nIt is important in this report to know the names of the wards being discussed across Birmingham as shown in this map.

The dataset needs to be re coded to create a variable showing the percentage of people who have never worked in each ward. This could be combined with those who said they had not worked in the last 12 months, HOWEVER the 2021 census took place just after the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, where many people were out of work in that period, so just using 'unemployment: never worked' will be the most reliable data. Additionally, these people are most likely to have stayed unemployed instead of starting work like the 12 month category.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Load dataset which contains unemployment data \nunemployment_input <- read.csv(\"ts065/census2021-ts065-ward.csv\")\n#Recode dataset to create a variable showing % of people who have never worked in each ward\nunemployment <- data.frame(ward_code=unemployment_input$geography.code,\n                           Unemployment_perc=(unemployment_input$Employment.history..Not.in.employment..Never.worked/unemployment_input$Employment.history..Total..All.usual.residents.aged.16.years.and.over.not.in.employment.the.week.before.the.census)*100)\n#Save dataset to workspace\nwrite.csv(unemployment, \"unemployment_data_ward.csv\", row.names=F)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe .csv file created with unemployment percentage of each ward needs to be merged to the large spatial data frame which contains the shapes of all of the wards in Birmingham.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Merge unemployment data to the main spatial file\nWard_Birmingham_Census<- merge(Wards_Birmingham, unemployment, by.x=\"WD23CD\", by.y=\"ward_code\", all.x=T)\n#Replace all NAs with 0\nWard_Birmingham_Census[is.na(Ward_Birmingham_Census)] = 0\nView(Ward_Birmingham_Census)\n#All has merged correctly\n```\n:::\n\n\nBy viewing the dataset, it is easy to determine whether the columns have merged correctly. In each dataset there is a column for the ward code identifier, so it is specified in R that these two columns are the merging point of the two datasets.\n\nWith these preparation tasks being completed, a map can be produced to show unemployment percentages across Birmingham, with a layer of dots on the map to indicate where weapon possession crimes took place in 2023, as shown below. Breaks have been appropriately set by viewing the distribution of unemployment data\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Choropleth map of weapon crime dots and unemployment percentage across wards\ntm_shape(Ward_Birmingham_Census) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Unemployment_perc\",\n          style = \"fixed\",\n          palette = c(\"#dadaeb\", \"#bcbddc\", \"#9e9ac8\", \"#807dba\", \"#6a51a3\", \"#4a1486\"),\n          n = 6,\n          breaks = c(17, 29, 33, 36, 43, 54, 67),\n          title = \"% of Unemployed residents in Ward\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd=0.4, \n             col = 'black', \n             alpha = 0.8) +\n  tm_shape(LA_Birmingham) +\n  tm_borders(lwd=2, \n             col = 'black', \n             alpha = 1) +\n  tm_shape(weapons_birmingham_2023)+\n  tm_dots(col = 'red',\n          size = 0.05) +\n  tm_layout(main.title = \"% of Unemployed Residents and Weapon Crimes in Birmingham\",\n            main.title.fontface = 2,\n            fontfamily = \"Mukta\",\n            legend.outside = TRUE,\n            frame = FALSE, \n            legend.outside.position = \"right\",\n            legend.title.size = 1,\n            legend.title.fontface = 2) +\n  tm_compass(type = \"arrow\",\n             position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) +\n  tm_scale_bar(breaks = c(0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10),\n               position = c(\"left\", \"top\")) +\n  tm_credits('Data source: West Midlands Police, ONS, Nomis',\n             fontface = 'italic',\n             align = 'right',\n             size = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](weapon_crime_social_atlas_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRed dots indicate each weapon possession crime which took place in 2023.

However, three stations: Birmingham New Street, Birmingham Snow Hill, and Birmingham Moor Street, in the city centre have a cluster of weapon crimes occurring within a 500m radius. This makes sense as these are the three stations which connect Birmingham to other major cities in the UK, such as Manchester and London, being a node for people unfamiliar to Birmingham to enter the city.\n\nA major caveat to this is that weapon possession crimes are statistically more likely to occur in a city centre where large groups of people form, and that the large number of crimes by the central stations is a product of this.\n\n## Conclusions and Final Remarks\n\nIn conclusion, this social atlas shows that weapon possession crimes are unevenly distributed in West Midlands County, with clear clusters being identified. The report showed that in certain areas, (Central Birmingham & Solihull) using GWR, there is a positive correlation between the IMD and weapon crime. Additionally, there appears to be a link between unemployment and weapon crime, but it is less clear whether weapon crimes cluster around railway stations. The findings illustrate that there are many factors that link to weapon possession crimes, and that local councils, especially those in Birmingham need to provide strategies to prevent crimes from rising even further.\n\nIt is very important to note that this is not a conclusive study of every single factor which is linked to weapon possession crimes across the region, as for example, population density and household income, among many other factors, need to be accounted for when producing a wider study of the issue. Some of these variables may help to explain some of the trends found in this report, such as why crimes are concentrated in city centres.\n\nOverall, I hope this report provides an overview of weapon crime issues in West Midlands County, and also an overview of different geospatial techniques that can be conducted in RStudio on geospatial data, and large data sets with geographic elements present.\n\n## References\n\nAllen, G., H.
